Adds an option to the Settings Menu to globally turn off the front end Toolbar and/or turn off the user option in the profile to show Toolbar.

Brute Force plugin (included), removes ALL Toolbars (admin and front end) as well as the profile user option. No settings are available for this plugin. WordPress does not provide an easy method to remove the Admin Tool Bar in the back end, so this plugin takes a different approach to override it!

It just simply adds an option page for you to turn the front end Toolbar on or off.
